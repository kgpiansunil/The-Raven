# The-Raven
A Social Networking Android Application

* Raven is a social networking application incorporating the features of any modern day social networking app like

  1. Timeline/News-Feed
  2. Sending/Receiving friend requests.
  3. Chatting with friends(sending texts and images). 
  4. Last seen feature/Is online or offline? (similar to whatsapp/messenger).
  5. Sharing/Posting something(image or a text or both).
  6. Visiting the profile of our friends and seeing their friends and posts.
  7. Liking and Commenting on other posts.
  8. Receiving friend-request and messages notifications.
  9. Searching for other users.

* I almost entirely used Firebase for making this including Firebase Realtime Database Service, Firebase Authentication Service, Firebase Storage Service, Firebase Functions and FCM(Firebase Cloud Messaging Service).

* RSA is used for message encryption and security.
